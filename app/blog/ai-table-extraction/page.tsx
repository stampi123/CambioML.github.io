      <BlogSectionTitle title="What Is AI Table Extraction?" />
      <BlogParagraph>
        AI table extraction is the application of intelligent document parsing techniques tailored to identify, extract,
        and organize structured data from tables in various document formats. Unlike traditional rule-based methods,
        AI-driven approaches utilize advanced technologies to tackle complex challenges, such as non-standard layouts,
        merged cells, and multi-line headers.
      </BlogParagraph>
      <BlogParagraph>
        A key advancement in this field is the use of Vision-Language Models (VLMs). VLMs combine the strengths of
        computer vision and natural language understanding, enabling them to interpret both visual and textual elements
        within a document. This dual capability allows VLMs to:
