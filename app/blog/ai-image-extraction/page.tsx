      <BlogSectionTitle title="What is AI Image Extraction?" />
      <BlogParagraph>
        AI image extraction involves using advanced artificial intelligence techniques, particularly those powered by
        Visual Language Models (VLMs), to identify, analyze, and extract meaningful information from images embedded in
        documents. Unlike traditional methods, which rely on rule-based approaches or basic image processing, AI-driven
        extraction incorporates contextual understanding to enhance accuracy and scalability.
      </BlogParagraph>
      <BlogParagraph>
        VLMs combine computer vision and natural language processing to interpret both the visual elements (such as
        shapes, colors, and layouts) and the embedded text within an image. For example, a VLM can not only extract text
        from a scanned invoice but also understand its role (e.g., labeling a value as a subtotal or tax amount based on
        its spatial relationship with other text). This multimodal capability allows AI to go beyond surface-level data
        extraction, enabling it to process complex visuals like annotated diagrams, charts, or mixed-language content.
